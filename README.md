 # Parser for Arithmetic Operations in Hindi Language
# This is a parser built in JavaScript that can parse arithmetic operations written in Hindi language
This is a parser built in JavaScript that can parse arithmetic operations written in Hindi language, which is an Indian language. It follows the BODMAS (Bracket, Order, Division and Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) rule to evaluate expressions. The parser can handle input strings that include Hindi words for division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction operations, as well as decimals, brackets, and whitespace. Notably, this parser does not use any built-in parsing mechanisms such as the `eval()` method.
